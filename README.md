## Getting to the Venue, Getting around SF

The civil ceremony will be held at or near [the Grand Staircase][city_hall] in
SF City Hall; the judge performing the civil ceremony chooses the ultimate
location. You will need to enter on Polk Street and pass through security.

## What to do in SF?

- Golden Gate Park
- [The Garden for the Environment](https://www.gardenfortheenvironment.org/)

## Registry

We do not have a registry and actually have no room for gifts! Your presence is
the greatest gift to us. Should you still feel the need to make a contribution,
we recommend making a donation to a social relief organization in your
community. We also recommend:
- [The Interational Rescue Committee](https://www.rescue.org/)

### FAQ

* What do we do about [Coronavirus][covid-19]?

We are closely monitoring the news about Coronavirus in the Bay Area. If we feel
that travel poses a danger, we will reschedule the civil ceremony for later in
2020.

* What should I wear?

Layers! San Francisco is chilly most of the year; we recommend bringing a jacket
and a light sweater as appropriate.
