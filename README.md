## The Ceremony

The civil ceremony will be held at or near [the Grand Staircase][city_hall] in
SF City Hall; the judge performing the civil ceremony chooses the ultimate
location. You will need to enter on Polk Street; please allow enough time to
pass through security.

## What to do (and what to avoid) in SF?

If you do nothing else while in town, we recommend spending time in *Golden Gate
Park* and the [*Garden for the Environment*][gfe]. We've also made [**this
map**][sf_map] for key locations and recommendation during the week and will
rent a car to ferry folks around.

We **strongly recommend** that you avoid Downtown, Fisherman's Wharf, and the
Market Street corridor during the business week.

## Photos

We'll share photos of the City Hall event in this [album][album], and will send
out print copies when they are available. Please upload any photos to the
[album][album].

## Registry

We do not have a registry and actually have no room for gifts! Your presence is
the greatest gift to us. Should you still feel the need to make a contribution,
we recommend making a donation to any of the following organizations:

- [The Interational Rescue Committee](https://www.rescue.org/)
- [Larkin Street Youth Services](https://larkinstreetyouth.org/)

## FAQ

### [Coronavirus][covid-19]?

We are closely monitoring the news about Coronavirus in the Bay Area: **please
let us know if you have any concerns**. We expect airlines to restrict domestic
air travel into San Francisco if the situation deteriorates. If we feel that
travel to SF poses a danger, we will reschedule the civil ceremony for later in
2020.

Check the [SFDPH status page][sfdph] for local updates.

### What should I wear?

Layers! San Francisco is chilly most of the year; we recommend bringing a jacket
and a light sweater as appropriate.

For any questions not covered, please contact [Buro](mailto:mookerji@gmail.com)
and [Maggie](mailto:emmbeezee@gmail.com), or text us directly.
